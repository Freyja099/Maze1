<p> <span style="font-weight:bold; color :rgb(127, 71, 169); "> 1.Maze Generation </span> - The maze is not always well-structured; paths may feel random and lack meaningful design. - Sometimes the generated maze may appear repetitive or less challenging. </p>
<p> <span style="font-weight:bold; color :rgb(127, 71, 169); ">
2.  Gameplay</span>- Movement can occasionally feel unresponsive in certain situations. - The game lacks clear visual indicators for start and end points beyond their colors. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold; color :rgb(127, 71, 169); ">
3. Design</span> - The overall graphical design is very basic and lacks polish. - There are no animations or advanced visual effects, which reduces player immersion.

<h1 align="center">Future Improvements :</h1>  
<p>
- Implement a more robust maze generation algorithm (e.g., Prim's or Kruskal's) to ensure better structure.<br>
-  Enhance the graphical design with textures, animations, and visual themes. 
<br>
-  Introduce new mechanics, such as traps, moving obstacles, or collectibles, to improve gameplay variety. <br>
-  Add sound effects and music for a more engaging experience.
